**Iris Data Classification**

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on classifying iris flowers into different species based on their petal and sepal dimensions. The project explores various machine learning algorithms and techniques to achieve accurate classification.

**Problem Statement**

The goal is to classify iris flowers into species (setosa, versicolor, or virginica) based on features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. This classification task helps in understanding and predicting species based on botanical features.

**Key Features**

- **Dataset:** Utilizes the famous Iris dataset from Fisher's paper.
- **Features:** Includes sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- **Algorithms:** Implements classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, and K-Nearest Neighbors.

**Data Science Lifecycle**

The project encompasses the following stages:

- **Data Loading and Exploration:** Comprehensive exploration of the Iris dataset.
- **Data Visualization:** Creation of visualizations to understand relationships between features and species.
- **Model Training and Evaluation:** Implementation of machine learning models to classify iris species.
- **Performance Metrics:** Evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

**Machine Learning Models**

Implemented machine learning models include:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **Decision Trees**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**

Each model's performance is evaluated to determine the most effective algorithm for iris classification.

**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation within the context of iris flower classification. Insights gained contribute to understanding and predicting species based on botanical features, showcasing practical applications of machine learning in biological sciences.
